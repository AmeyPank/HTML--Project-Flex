        <h1>Computer Programming</h1>
        <p>
            Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation
            (or more generally,
            accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer
            program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms'
            accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming
            language, commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more
            languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by
            the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will
            automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often
            for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different
            subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
            implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of
            computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term
            software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or
            coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques
            with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers,
            analysts, and programmers to understand an existing program and re-implement its function.
